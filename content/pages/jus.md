[JusToolkit](https://github.com/priverop/JUSToolkit) is my main personal project. It's a localization tool for the videogame "Jump Ultimate Stars!" of Nintendo DS.

This tool allows the translator to export or import data from/to the game. It works with containers, text and images. 

Read the full story of the project [here](/posts/jus-story/).

## Roadmap

**2025 Q4**: 
- Fix palette issues of DSIG images.
- Finish small files of English translation: there are some small files that I could translate to reduce the number of total files to translate.

**2026**:
- Sprite importing with Ekona.
- Research DTX 83.
- Debug DTX 03 Tx importing issue. The game crashes when modifying the number of segments of any sprite.
