## Who am I?

I'm Pablo, a Tech Lead with over 10 years of experience leading and building projects.

Iâ€™m a generalist by nature with a minimalist mindset. I focus on removing waste, automation and prioritizing what's really important. 

Proactive and passionate. I love No Code, DevOps, and software quality (yes, I do enjoy writing tests).

Check [my bio](/posts/bio/) for more info!


## My 10 laws

These are some of my personal core values. This is how I love working, and how I think teams should work:

- **Global vision**: we're not just laying bricks, we are building a castle. Understand the "why" behind every feature.
- **Minimalism:** Pareto's Law, YAGNI and KISS principles, remove waste rather than adding more stuff to your workflows. Clients/users will give you feedback, but only you should know what is really important.
- **DevOps:** automatic testing, CI/CD are mandatory if we want to stay productive.
- **Peopleware:** projects are about people, ideas are worth nothing. The right attitude outperforms the right ideas long term.
- **NoCode:** writing code is the opposite of AI vibe coding. No Code is the sweetspot: speed, learning curve and control.
- **Goals, not time:** time spent is irrelevant, created value is what matters. Parkinson's Law.
- **Avoid bottlenecks:** create T-Shaped people. Specialists create bottlenecks. Leade people into not needing you.
- **Document issues**: create your own Stack Overflow. Write summaries. CTRL+F is underrated.
- **Use meetings wisely**: most can be replaced by writing, but some unlock creativity.
- **ASAP is toxic**: true urgency is rare. Teach people by not feeding "ASAP".
