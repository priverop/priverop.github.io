## Who am I?

I'm Pablo, a Tech Lead with over 10 years of experience leading and building projects.

Iâ€™m a generalist by nature with a minimalist mindset. I focus on removing waste, automation and prioritizing what's really important. 

Proactive and passionate. I love No Code, DevOps, and software quality (yes, I do enjoy writing tests).

## Bio

When I was 5 I hacked a Mickey Mouse computer game, so I could play without the parental control. Nobody knew how, me? neither.

At 14 I learned Photoshop and started making videogame posters for my friends. Then I learned HTML and CSS for my first online portfolio, but I realized how much time it took to update the site, so I learned PHP to automate the work. I created a template that allowed me to make quick websites for my friends and family.

At 18 two friends and I created a small business called N3Networks to make websites for small companies. I had to stop during college because of the workload. But I learned a valuable lesson: clients rarely know what they want.

During university, I discovered leadership while organizing eSports tournaments. I met some professional players, and I started making events with them (worked for Nintendo in some of them). Years later we did a 300 person tournament, with players all around the world. I also did a crowdfunding to flew me and my friends to a UK tournament, reaching the goal of 3500â‚¬.

Now, after all these years, I know that wherever I go, I tend to organize, structure, and improve things. But not by choice, it's just how I'm wired. 

## Core Values

These are some of my personal "laws". This is how I love working, and how I think teams should work:

- **Global vision**: we're not just laying bricks, we are building a castle. Understand the "why" behind every feature.
- **Minimalism:** Pareto's Law, YAGNI and KISS principles, remove waste rather than adding more stuff to your workflows. Clients/users will give you feedback, but only you should know what is really important.
- **DevOps:** automatic testing, CI/CD are mandatory if we want to stay productive.
- **Peopleware:** projects are about people, ideas are worth nothing. The right attitude outperforms the right ideas long term.
- **NoCode:** writing code is the opposite of AI vibe coding. NoCode is the sweetspot: speed, learning curve and control.
- **Goals, not time:** time spent is irrelevant, created value is what matters. Parkinson's Law.
- **Avoid bottlenecks:** create T-Shaped people. Specialists create bottlenecks. Leade people into not needing you.
- **Document issues**: create your own Stack Overflow. Write summaries. CTRL+F is underrated.
- **Use meetings wisely**: most can be replaced by writing, but some unlock creativity.
- **ASAP is toxic**: true urgency is rare. Teach people by not feeding "ASAP".
