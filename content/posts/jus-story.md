## Introduction

In 2008, after learning Photoshop and getting into web design, I joined a [fanmade translation project](https://www.elotrolado.net/hilo_100-voces-traduccion-del-twewy_1002815) for The World Ends With You, a videogame I was obsessed about.

That project introduced me into reverse engineering and localization, and gave me my first real project in English.

## The first JUS translation

After that, I collaborated in a couple of projects here and there, until one finally became my main focus: [Jump Ultimate Stars!](https://web.archive.org/web/20100419132357/https://www.espalnds.com/foros/showthread.php?t=34478) (_JUS_). 

We spent two years translating, editing images, researching... Until the leader (romhacker and coder) of the project had to leave; so we deceided to stop. The game was 70% translated.

## Tradusquare

In 2018 I joined Tradusquare, the main Spanish fan-translation community, where I helped doing graphic editing and coding.
I developed multiple tools ([see here](https://github.com/stars/priverop/lists/my-romhacking-tools)) and made a post about a basic example of romhacking ([read it](https://priverop.medium.com/coming-back-to-rom-hacking-3d7e98262082)).

I also started collaborating in SceneGate, a set of reverse engineering tools written in C#. Besides giving feedback of the tools, discussing new features and architecture, my main contributions were creating guides for the newcomers. Check my [recent one in Texim](https://code.pleonex.dev/SceneGate/Texim/pulls/37), an image library.

That experience made me believe that we could finish and improve the JUS translation. 

## The new JUS translation

I created [JUS-Toolkit](https://github.com/priverop/JUSToolkit) to automate text and images exporting and importing.

What started as a continuation quickly became a full remake: new tools, new research, and a massive new scope that required way more work than we expected.

## New blood

In 2019, one of our translators, **Darkc0m**, told me he wanted to learn about reverse engineering. At that time, I couldnâ€™t dedicate much time to the project because of my job, so he ended up taking the lead.

He was a fast learner, a great coder, and managed to keep the project alive for two years while I supported him when possible.

Together with Pleonex, a well-known NDS reverse engineer, we managed to hack most of the formats and translate 90% of the texts of the game.

## 2024 personal year

In 2024, after being laid off from my position at Astara, I took a personal year, which allowed me to make significant progress on the project.

I completed the last major reverse-engineering challenges and assembled a new small team of English and Japanese translators.

My goal for 2026 is to finalize the toolset and focus entirely on translation and polishing.
