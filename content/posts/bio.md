When I was 5 I hacked a Mickey Mouse computer game, so I could play without the parental control. Nobody knew how, me? neither.

At 14 I learned Photoshop and started making videogame posters for my friends. Then I learned HTML and CSS for my first online portfolio, but I realized how much time it took to update the site, so I learned PHP to automate the work. I created a template that allowed me to make quick websites for my friends and family.

At 18 two friends and I created a small business called N3Networks to make websites for small companies. I had to stop during college because of the workload. But I learned a valuable lesson: clients rarely know what they want.

During university, I discovered leadership while organizing eSports tournaments. I met some professional players, and I started making events with them (worked for Nintendo in some of them). Years later we did a 300 person tournament, with players all around the world. I also did a crowdfunding to flew me and my friends to a UK tournament, reaching the goal of 3500â‚¬.

Now, after all these years, I know that wherever I go, I tend to organize, structure, and improve things. But not by choice, it's just how I'm wired.
